The topic of my project is to show severity of bleaching in coral reefs around the Florida Keys. The data that will be used is severity
conditions of the reefs, ocean temperature, and pollution rates. This data will be collected from the World Resource Institute. I will
need subset the data to the florida keys region to be able to perform analysis. I will perform interpolation on the data and will test
clumping of variables in R as well as see the spatial relationship between high ocean temperatures and high bleaching in the reefs. This will
also be perfomed on pollution levels in the area leading into the Gulf of Mexico. The outputs i will be creating are G functions and maps in
R and QGIs to show the relationship between high water temps and pollution with bleaching in the reefs.
