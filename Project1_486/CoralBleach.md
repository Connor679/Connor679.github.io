## Coral Reef Bleaching throughout Florida Keys and Australia

**Project description:** This project consists of maps presenting the severity conditions of coral reefs throughout Australia and the Florida Keys. These areas are analyzed for the amount of coral bleaching happening in the regions. These areas will then be analyzed for differences in temperature and pollution throughout the areas to see if this could be the causes of bleaching throughout the regions
