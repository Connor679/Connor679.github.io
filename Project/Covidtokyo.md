## The amount of tweets regading COVID 19 vs Tokyo Olympics 2020 per state

**Project description:** This project consists of a map representing the amount of tweets that each state is producing either Covid19 or the Olympics in Tokyo 2020. This was a major topic becasue this was only days after the Olympics were changed and pushed back a year. Throughout the data, it is shown that tweets regarding COVID19 are more prominent that that of the Olympics. Although, this is not surprising it shows a lot about the severity of this pandemic and the people affected.
