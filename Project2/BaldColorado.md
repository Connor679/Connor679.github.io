## The Relationship Between Fish Presence and Bald Eagle Nests in Colorado

<img src="../images/baldbanner.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Project description:** This project consists of maps and R code presenting the relationship between Bald Eagle nests and Fish Presence in Colorado. In this project, maps of the fish presence and bald eagle nests were made to visually show the spread of areas throughout the state. R code was used to make 1 km buffers around the Eagle Nest file and show the intersections with fish presence throughout the state.

## Bald Eagles Nests

This Figure shows that Bald Eagle Nests are spread out throughout the entire state. The area with the highest presence shown in the Heatmap to the left is near the Denver area. This area is more populated but ultimatley leads to the edge of the Rocky Mountains. This area has the highest Eagle Nest population in the country. Each Nest does have conditions associated to it. The colors reppresent whether the nest is Active, Destroyed, Inactive, Undetermined, or Unknown. These conditions are shown throughout the entire state. As you can see from the figure, most of the nests throughout the state are either Active or Unknown.

The major bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef is occurring close to the coast line. This exesive bleaching could be due to larger amounts of pollution closer to the shores. This topic will be further researched in the project.

## Temperature
Two main affects of coral Bleaching are temperature changes and pollution levels in the reefs. Below the global temperature differences are shown.
