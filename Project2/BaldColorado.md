## The Relationship Between Fish Presence and Bald Eagle Nests in Colorado

**Project description:** This project consists of maps and R code presenting the relationship between Bald Eagle nests and Fish Presence in Colorado. In this project, maps of the fish presence and bald eagle nests were made to visually show the spread of areas throughout the state. R code was used to make 1 km buffers around the Eagle Nest file and show the intersections with fish presence throughout the state.

The Florida Keys have had many changes throughout the years regarding bleaching throughout the reefs. Coral reef bleaching has been reported in the dataset since the 1970s. The Figure below shows the influx of bleached coral reefs over time throughout the Florida Keys.

## Fish Presence

The major bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef is occurring close to the coast line. This exesive bleaching could be due to larger amounts of pollution closer to the shores. This topic will be further researched in the project.

## Temperature
Two main affects of coral Bleaching are temperature changes and pollution levels in the reefs. Below the global temperature differences are shown.
